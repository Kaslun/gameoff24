# Description
Shutdown Protocol is a puzzle-adventure game where you navigate an old-school computer system to unlock commands and ultimately shut it down. You start with a single command, help, and progress by playing mini-games and solving puzzles to unlock new commands like list and open. Each command brings you closer to the final goal: shutting down the computer so you can finally leave work.

The game is built around exploration, problem-solving, and a retro-inspired interface. You’ll dig through menus, discover hidden files, and complete challenges to unravel the system’s structure. Mini-games like Pong are your stepping stones, unlocking tools and commands needed to proceed.

The objective? Find the a way to turn off the computer so you can go home. It's that easy.
