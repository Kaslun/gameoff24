Hey Steve,
Thanks for the lifehack you set up! It really gave me an out for spending time on something other than work - but I should probably not admit to that, huh? Haha, funny joke, right?
Anyways, sucks that you were called in for an evaluation because of the last mail. For a "Mastermind" like you, I bet you felt pretty INFURIATED, right? ;)
Just in case you didn't catch it, there's something interesting hidden in the mail!!!

Kyle, you basically just self-reported.
