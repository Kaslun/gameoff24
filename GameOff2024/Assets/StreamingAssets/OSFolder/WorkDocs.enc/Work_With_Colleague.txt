Hi Kyle.
Again, thank you for helping me "set up" the workspace. Not sure I would get it up and running so fast otherwise! Given the deadline set by Alan, it sure was a blessing. Maybe I can treat you to a coffee later as a thank-you? Anyways, with this I've confirmed that the email is up and running. Now that I think about it, one more thing: I've gotten pretty comfortable with the OS on our machines, and if you take the first letter of each sentence and write it into Work, you'll get a nice surprise!
