Hello Tyler,
I'm afraid I'm not sure what you're referring to. While modifying the operative system is impressive, it goes against company policy to compromise our work-station. Also, as far as I can tell, you have misspelled the word.

Kyle! My man!
Really been enjoying the games you hacked into our computers, but I can't get into the latest one. I tried writing in the code Maya got, "psychofant", but it just doesn't work. Is it broken? Maybe you could send me a download of the content directly!
