Greetings,
as discussed during your last self reflection meeting, here is a non-exhaustive list of why we unfortunately had to deny you your increase in yearly income.
Greeting coworkers in an overly friendly manner, discussing non-work-related topics with coworkers, discussing work-related topics with coworkers, assisting coworkers, exceeding your allotted amount of daily mistakes, suspicious behavior by not making mistakes in a day, setting up events with coworkers outside of work.
These are the issues from the previous tertial. You would do well to have them in mind when you evaluate your office conduct.
Do not respond to this email.
From
Alan Farthsley, 
Senior Manager of Staff at Bartleby Consultant Calculators, Inc.
