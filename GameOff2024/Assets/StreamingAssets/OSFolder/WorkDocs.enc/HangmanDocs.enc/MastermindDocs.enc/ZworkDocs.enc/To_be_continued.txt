Hello! Kyle here.
If you're reading this, you made it as far as I have managed to make games on this system. Congratulations! I'm working diligently for some more entertainment, but for the moment this is as far as we get. Stop me by the coffee machine, and I'll tell you how it's going. 
Talk to you later, and stay sane out there!
PS: If you were looking for something else, you should probably play the game in the previous folder.
