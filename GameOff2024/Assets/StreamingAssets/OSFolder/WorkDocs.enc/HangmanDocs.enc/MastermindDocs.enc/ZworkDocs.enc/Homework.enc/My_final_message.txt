a final letter from a bitter whistleblower in which they vent their frustrations, giving the player an insight into their daily lives before they disappeared

If you're reading this, my little expos√© missed the mark. How do I know? 
Because you're sitting on what used to be MY computer. In other words, Bartleby and fiends is still chugging along.
I'm sure you've found it weird, right? What does "work" actually have to do with work? What do they gain? Why do they pay you? 
I'm sure your job title is something along the lines of "junior consultant". But you're not consulting much, are you?
All I can say is that sometime last year, something happened to the company. We went from scheduling customer meetings to 8 hours a day typing pointless words. Any more than this, and the system would say this document "had a malfunction". It's all clucking insane (and it's VERY good at picking up swear words).

Hopefully nobody ever gets to read this, but if you do, know that this is just the surface.
